In the digital age, restaurant choices are heavily influenced by online reviews, making it crucial for both restaurant owners and customers to understand the sentiments expressed in these evaluations.

Sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding customer sentiment towards restaurants.

For this project, we utilized a comprehensive dataset of restaurant reviews.

The dataset contains a diverse range of reviews, covering various cuisines, dining types, and locations

Our main objective is to create a sentiment analysis model that effectively categorizes reviews of restaurants.

Data Preprocessing: We performed data cleaning and text preprocessing to prepare the reviews for analysis.

Machine Learning: We employed various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM, to build sentiment classifiers.
